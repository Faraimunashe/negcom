This is a flask web application that sells vehicles online. I want use TailwindCss(CDN) for styling.
If you read in models.txt you will see my expected model which i want to create in models.py
I want the user to be able to negotiate the price of a vehicle.
This process might go back and forth. 
For example the user negotiates to buy a $10000 car at $8000.
The admin(or AI model) considers customer buying history, price of the car, price offered by customer, discount offable for that vehicle and customer rating. 
They might discount the car to a discountable fee, to customer asking price or might suggest like in my example $9500 or might not consider discounting for that customer at all. 
Customers should be able to review the system, whilist admins can rate customer or customer maybe automatically reviewed.
We will create the AI model when everything else is done.


Let me review what we've accomplished and identify what still needs to be done in this vehicle sales/negotiation system.

Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's what we have accomplished and what still needs to be done:

## ‚úÖ **What We've Completed:**

- ‚ùå **Customer Order Flow** - `orders/payment.html` (exists but needs implementation)
- ‚ùå **Customer Negotiation Interface** - `negotiations/create.html`, `negotiations/detail.html` (exist but need implementation)

### **4. Missing Routes**
- ‚ùå **Customer Vehicle Routes** - Browse, search, detail views
- ‚ùå **Customer Order Routes** - Create orders, payment processing
- ‚ùå **Customer Negotiation Routes** - Create negotiations, make offers
- ‚ùå **Customer Dashboard** - Personal account management

### **5. Integration & Polish**
- ‚ùå **Payment Gateway Integration** - Stripe, PayPal, etc.
- ‚ùå **Email System** - SMTP configuration and templates
- ‚ùå **File Upload Limits** - Proper file size and type validation
- ‚ùå **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error pages

## üéØ **Priority Order for Completion:**

1. **Customer Vehicle Browsing & Details** (High Priority)
2. **Order Creation & Payment Flow** (High Priority)
3. **Negotiation System for Customers** (High Priority)
4. **Customer Dashboard** (Medium Priority)
5. **Payment Gateway Integration** (Medium Priority)
6. **Email Notifications** (Low Priority)
7. **Polish & Optimization** (Low Priority)

The system currently has a fully functional admin panel but is missing the core customer-facing functionality that would make it a complete vehicle sales platform. Would you like me to start implementing any of these missing features?
