This is a flask web application that sells vehicles online. I want use TailwindCss(CDN) for styling.
If you read in models.txt you will see my expected model which i want to create in models.py
I want the user to be able to negotiate the price of a vehicle.
This process might go back and forth. 
For example the user negotiates to buy a $10000 car at $8000.
The admin(or AI model) considers customer buying history, price of the car, price offered by customer, discount offable for that vehicle and customer rating. 
They might discount the car to a discountable fee, to customer asking price or might suggest like in my example $9500 or might not consider discounting for that customer at all. 
Customers should be able to review the system, whilist admins can rate customer or customer maybe automatically reviewed.
We will create the AI model when everything else is done.
